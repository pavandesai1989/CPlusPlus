The Diamond Problem occurs in the following inheritance structure:
       A
     /   \
    B     C
     \   /
      D
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "A::show()" << endl;
    }
};

class B : public A { };
class C : public A { };
class D : public B, public C { };

int main() {
    D obj;
    obj.show();  // error 
    return 0;
}
// ❌ error: request for member 'show' is ambiguous

Class D inherits from both B and C.

Both B and C inherit from A, so now D contains two copies of class A.

Therefore, the call obj.show() is ambiguous:

Compiler doesn't know whether to call B::A::show() or C::A::show().

Memory Diagram (Conceptually)
         A
       /   \
     B       C
       \   /
         D

In reality, without virtual inheritance, D contains two separate A subobjects:

One via B

One via C

Hence, calling show() is ambiguous.


How to Fix: Use Virtual Inheritance
Change both B and C to inherit A virtually:
class A {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "A::show()" << endl;
    }
};

class B : virtual public A { };
class C : virtual public A { };
class D : public B, public C { };

int main() {
    D obj;
    obj.show();  // ✅ No ambiguity
    return 0;
}

 Why This Works
With virtual inheritance, only one shared copy of A exists in D.

Now the compiler knows exactly which show() to call → no ambiguity.

This is known as the diamond problem in C++ multiple inheritance.


 Solution: Virtual Inheritance
Now let's declare B and C like this:
class A { };
class B : virtual public A { };
class C : virtual public A { };
class D : public B, public C { };

D obj;

Now, both B and C point to the same A, and there's only one copy.

obj (D)
├── B
├── C
└── A  ← shared single copy

so this works 
obj.show();  // ✅ Calls A::show() — unambiguous

How Virtual Inheritance Works Internally
With virtual inheritance, B and C don’t embed their own copies of A.

Instead, they store a pointer/reference to a single shared instance of A created by D.

This eliminates the ambiguity and multiple copies.
