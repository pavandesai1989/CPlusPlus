"Yes, the * and -> operators can be overloaded. They are most commonly used when implementing smart pointers, so that the smart pointer behaves like a raw pointer."

template <typename T>
class SmartPtr {
    T* ptr;
public:
    explicit SmartPtr(T* p = nullptr) : ptr(p) {}
    ~SmartPtr() { delete ptr; }

    T& operator*() { return *ptr; }   // dereference operator
    T* operator->() { return ptr; }   // arrow operator
};


struct Test {
    void show() { cout << "Hello from Test!" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    SmartPtr<int> p1(new int(42));
    cout << *p1 << endl;   // calls operator* → prints 42

    SmartPtr<Test> p2(new Test());
    p2->show();            // calls operator-> → prints message
}

How to explain in the interview

operator* returns a reference to the managed object, just like dereferencing a raw pointer.

operator-> returns the raw pointer, which lets us call member functions directly.

This is exactly how std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr are implemented in the STL.

"So in short, overloading * and -> allows us to give pointer-like semantics to our class, which is the core idea behind smart pointers in modern C++."
