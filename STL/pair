std::pair in C++
std::pair is a simple container in the C++ STL that holds two heterogeneous objects as a single unit — like a struct with two public members.

std::pair<T1, T2> name;


Pair is used to combine together two values that may be different in type. Pair provides a way to store two heterogeneous objects as a 
single unit.
The pair container is a simple container defined in <utility> header consisting of two data elements or objects
The first element is referenced as ‘first’ and the second element as ‘second’ and the order is fixed (first, second).
NOTE: If not initialized, the first value of the pair gets automatically initialized. 

int main()
{
    pair<string,int> p1;
    p1.first = "pavan";
    p1.second = 24;
    
    pair<string,int> p2{"raj",24};
    pair<string,int> p3 = {"rajth",27};
    
    pair<int,int> p4(3,4);
    
    //use below
    pair<int,int> p = make_pair(3,56);
    
    cout<<p1.first<<" "<<p1.second<<endl;
}

/******** tie function********/
int main()
{
    pair<int, int> pair1 = { 1, 2 };
    int a, b;
    //get the values in to var
    tie(a, b) = pair1;
    cout << a << " " << b << "\n";
    
    pair<int, int> pair2 = { 3, 4 };
    tie(a, ignore) = pair2;  //ignore wont unpack the value of b
}
